# *foreign-language-decisions*

## **Description of Data**
- This dataset comes from a study by Janet Geipel that investigated how moral judgement may differ based on native versus foreign language.
- There are 105 participants from the University of Trento that are native Italian with some knowing German or English as a second language. 
- Participants were presented with the trolley problem (an impersonal dilemma), the footbridge problem (a personal dilemma), and/or a non-moral dilemma. 
- [study by Janet](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131529)
- The goal of this study is to see if people approach moral dilemmas differently based on the language (native versus foreign) the dilemma is presented in.
