## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r forloop}
# for loops 
for (i in 1:5) { #for i=1, then i=2, until i=5
  print(i) # print the current value of i to the console
} # move to the next iteration in the loop (i + 1)

# i is used typically, comes from "iteraiton"
```
```{r whileloop}
# while loops

i <- 1 # i must start as something

while (i < 6) { #while i i sless than 6
  print(i) # print the current value of i to the console
  i <- i + 1 # add one to the value of i
} #check whether the "while" condition still holds

# cannot use for loop or it wouold run forever, the while loop limits it to i < 6
